Hi,this is Monika Varshini.I am 13 years old.I always love doing something creative!During the lockdown,I developed my intrest in arts and progarmming!I really enjoy doing them!
I started my [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/moni_varshi_arts/) at october 2020.I got so much support from people and they started liking my artworks which amazed me!
It really motivated  me a lot! Finally!within 4 months I got my first 1000 followers!I was soo happy!Art is like a therapy for me. It gives me peace of mind :) One of the best thing that happened to me in 2020 is I have learnt a lot about myself. I have also learnt coding at [whitehatjr](https://www.whitehatjr.com/).I enjoy learning coding! I am so lucky to have Mrs.Rohini as my coding teacher! She is an amazing teacher who patiently teaches and clears my doubts :) Check out my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1M6k9S0ZTdUYeZIRBnbZTA)
