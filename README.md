It really motivated  me a lot! Finally!within 4 months I got my first 1000 followers!I was soo happy!Art is like a therapy for me. It gives me peace of mind :) One of the best thing that happened to me in 2020 is I have learnt a lot about myself. I have also learnt coding at [whitehatjr](https://www.whitehatjr.com/).I enjoy learning coding! I am so lucky to have Mrs.Rohini as my coding teacher! She is an amazing teacher who patiently teaches and clears my doubts :) Thank you Ma'am.
